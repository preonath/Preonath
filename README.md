### 👋 Hi, I’m Preonath Chondrow Dev (@Preonath)
   🔬 Research Officer | Child Health Research Foundation (CHRF)
   
   As a Research Officer at the Child Health Research Foundation (CHRF), I leverage bioinformatics tools and computational methods to analyze and interpret large-scale biological datasets. My work directly supports research aimed 
   at improving child health outcomes, with a focus on genomic surveillance, infectious disease diagnostics, and public health initiatives.
   I collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to:
  
      - Process and analyze high-throughput sequencing data 
      - Develop and optimize bioinformatics pipelines
      - Interpret results to support evidence-based decisions in pediatric health research
      - Contribute to publications and open-source tools for global health improvement
